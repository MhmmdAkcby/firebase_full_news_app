# firebase_full_news_app

In this project, I developed a news application using Flutter and Firebase, following clean code principles
 and adhering to SOLID design patterns. The app is built with a modular architecture, utilizing Riverpod for
 state management, ensuring maintainability and scalability. It features real-time news updates, user
 authentication, and cloud storage, all integrated through Firebase services. Additionally, I focused on
 responsive design using Responsive Framework to provide an optimal experience across different device
 sizes
